# Shoe Fit Biomechanics: An Interactive Research Documentary

> *"Why does the Puma Rider FV feel like a cloud, while the Lacoste L003 Neo Tech feels like a vice?"*

## 📖 The Story

This project was born from genuine discomfort.

I had two pairs of shoes. My **Puma Rider FV** was an effortless daily driver—soft, forgiving, invisible on the foot. My **Lacoste L003 Neo Tech** was a different beast entirely. Despite being marketed as a "tech" shoe, it created a progressive, suffocating compression across the midfoot that eventually numbed my toes. After hours of wearing them, I realized exactly why I had intuitively buried them in the closet, preferring my old, worn-out Pumas.

Most advice I found was generic: *"Break them in,"* *"size up,"* or *"maybe you have wide feet."* None of it explained the actual physics of what was happening.

I decided to stop guessing and start engineering. I dove into the mechanics of last geometry, volume distribution, and material compliance. I discovered that the Lacoste's "elasticated adjustment system"—designed for lockdown—was failing to accommodate the natural **3-5% volume swelling** of the foot during the gait cycle. It was a perfect storm of volume mismatch and nerve compression.

I realized there wasn't a single, accessible resource that explained these invisible mechanics with the depth of a technical paper but the clarity of a story. So, I built this.

## 🔬 Project Overview

**Shoe Fit Biomechanics** is an interactive web experience that explores the hidden engineering behind foot discomfort. It rejects marketing fluff in favor of **"Clinical Minimalism"**—using precise visualizations, biomechanical data, and scrollytelling to explain exactly how shoes interact with feet.

### Key Research Areas
*   **Dynamic Foot Changes:** Visualizing how the foot swells and spreads during the gait cycle (3-5% volume increase).
*   **The Activation Paradox:** Why "supportive" shoes can actually increase muscle activation demands.
*   **Neurological Health:** The physics of "squeeze zones" and the mechanism behind conditions like Morton's neuroma.
*   **Material Compliance:** Analyzing the difference between static measurement and dynamic load response (EVA vs. TPU/PEBA).
*   **Thermal Dynamics:** The "Tight-Fit Bellows Paradox" and heat entrapment mechanics.


## 🛠️ Tech Stack
*   **Core:** HTML5, CSS3 (Custom Variables), Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+).
*   **Build Tool:** Vite (for fast development and bundled production builds).
*   **Styling:** CSS Grid/Flexbox, Scroll-driven animations (Intersection Observer).
*   **Assets:** Custom generated 1:1 aspect ratio scientific diagrams.
